# Credit-Risk
Predict if a loan application should be rejected or approved

# Context:
Credit risks refer to the risks of loss on a debt that occurs when the borrower fails to repay the principal and related interest amounts of a loan back to the lender on due dates.

When a bank receives a loan application, based on the applicantâ€™s profile the bank has to make a decision for its approval or rejection. There are two types of risks associated with this decision:
- If the applicant has good credit risk, i.e. is likely to repay the loan, then rejecting the loan results in a loss to the bank
- If the applicant has bad credit risk, i.e. is unlikely to repay the loan, then approving the loan results in a loss to the bank

# Objective:
You are required to build a machine learning model that helps you predict the credit risk of the loan applicants.

# Evaluation Criteria:
Submissions are evaluated using Accuracy Score.

# Structure
# Task1: Load the Data and Import Essential Libraries

# Task 2: Inspect the Data

# Task 3: Visualize the Data(EDA)

# Task 4: Data-preprocessing:

# Task 5: Spliting Data into X(independent variables) and y (dependent variable)

# Task 6: Train the model using Diffrent Ensemble technques:
- RandomForest Classifier
- Support vector Machine
- GradientBoosting Classifier

Conclusion :
- Support vector Machine is 75.20% accurate to predict if a loan application should be rejected or approved
